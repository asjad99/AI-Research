After more thought I decided that since I was trying to teach “style” of thinking in science and engineering, and “style” is an art, I should therefore copy the methods of teaching used for the other arts— once the fundamentals have been learned. How to be a great painter cannot be taught in words; one learns by trying many different approaches that seem to surround the subject. Art teachers usually let the advanced student paint, and then make suggestions on how they would have done it, or what might also be tried, more or less as the points arise in the student’s head—which is where the learning is supposed to occur! In this series of lectures I try to communicate to students what cannot be said in words—the essence of style in science and engineering. I have adopted a loose organization with some repetition since this often occurs in the lectures. There are, therefore, digressions and stories—with some told in two different places—all in the somewhat rambling, informal style typical of lectures.


I will examine, criticize, and display styles of thinking. To illustrate the points of style I will often use technical knowledge most of you know, but, again, it will be, I hope, in the form of a useful review which concentrates on the fundamentals.

The course is concerned with “style”, and almost by definition style cannot be taught in the normal manner by using words. I can only approach the topic through particular examples, which I hope are well within your grasp, though the examples come mainly from my 30 years in the mathematics department of the Research Division of Bell Telephone Laboratories (before it was broken up). It also comes from years of study of the work of others

The belief anything can be “talked about” in words was certainly held by the early Greek philosophers, Socrates (469–399), Plato (427–347), and Aristotle (384–322). This attitude ignored the current mystery cults of the time who asserted you had to “experience” some things which could not be communicated in words. Examples might be the gods, truth, justice, the arts, beauty, and love. Your scientific training has emphasized the role of words, along with a strong belief in reductionism, hence to emphasize the possible limitations of language I shall take up the topic in several places in the book. I have already said “style” is such a topic

I am, as it were, only a coach. I cannot run the mile for you; at best I can discuss styles and criticize yours.

Since the subject matter is “style”, I will use the comparison with teaching painting. Having learned the fundamentals of painting, you then study under a master you accept as being a great painter; but you know you must forge your own style out of the elements of various earlier painters plus your native abilities. You must also adapt your style to fit the future, since merely copying the past will not be enough if you aspire to future greatness—a matter I assume, and will talk about often in the book. I will show you my style as best I can, but, again, you must take those elements of it which seem to fit you, and you must finally create your own style.

Either you will be a leader, or a follower, and my goal is for you to be a leader.


Education is what, when, and why to do things, Training is how to do it.

Either one without the other is not of much use. You need to know both what to do and how to do it. I have already compared mental and physical training and said to a great extent in both you get out of it what you put into it—all the coach can do is suggest styles and criticize a bit now and then.


Key Lesson: Back of the envelope calculations are super helplful: 

The reason back of the envelop calculations are widely used by great scientists is clearly revealed—you get a good feeling for the truth or falsity of what was claimed, as well as realize which factors you were inclined not to think about, such as exactly what was meant by the lifetime of a scientist. Having done the calculation you are much more likely to retain the results in your mind.


Key Lesson: Learning to Learn, is the main solution I offer to help students cope with the rapid changes they will have to endure in their fields

The technical knowledge involved in your life will quadruple in 34 years, 

What is my answer to this dilemma? One answer is you must concentrate on fundamentals, at least what you think at the time are fundamentals, and also develop the ability to learn new fields of knowledge when

so How are you to recognize “fundamentals”? One test is they have lasted a long time. Another test is from the fundamentals all the rest of the field can be derived by using the standard methods in the field.

Key Lesson: Science Vs Engineering
In science if you know what you are doing you should not be doing it.

     In engineering if you do not know what you are doing you should not be doing it

but its hard to seperate the two…Much of present science rests on engineering tools, and as time goes on, engineering seems to involve more and more of the science part. Many of the large scientific projects involve very serious engineering problems—the two fields are growing together!

It should be noted that engineering is not just applied science, which is a distinct third field (though it is not often recognized as such) which lies between science and engineering.

Key Lesson: “Short term predictions are always optimistic and long term predictions are always pessimistic”

Often it is not physical limitations which control but rather it is human made laws, habits, and organizational rules, regulations, personal egos, and inertia, which dominate the evolution to the future

Key Lesson:  Always have a vision for you career - The unexamined life is not worth living.

Lastly, in a sense, this is a religious course—I am preaching the message that, with apparently only one life to live on this earth, you ought to try to make significant contributions to humanity rather than just get along through life comfortably—that the life of trying to achieve excellence in some area is in itself a worthy goal for your life. It has often been observed the true gain is in the struggle and not in the achievement—a life without a struggle on your part to make yourself excellent is hardly a life worth living.

| “So my advice to you is to pick one of the 10,000 categories, or invent category number 10,001, and make some progress in it. Pick problems that are ambitious enough that your expected value over the next 20 years is at least your $3.4M/yr share. But worry about the value you produce, not just the money. America's first great scientist, Ben Franklin, said "we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours". So be happy and productive, don't be evil, and be glad of an opportunity to serve others.” - Peter Norvig |



It is well known the drunken sailor who staggers to the left or right with n independent random steps will, on the average, end up about steps from the origin. But if there is a pretty girl in one direction, then his steps will tend to go in that direction and he will go a distance proportional to n. In a lifetime of many, many independent choices, small and large, a career with a vision will get you a distance proportional to n, while no vision will get you only the distance In a sense, the main difference between those who go far and those who do not is some people have a vision and the others do not and therefore can only react to the current events as they happen.

You will probably object that if you try to get a vision now it is likely to be wrong—and my reply is from observation I have seen the accuracy of the vision matters less than you might suppose, getting anywhere is better than drifting, there are potentially many paths to greatness for you, and just which path you go on, so long as it takes you to greatness, is none of my business. You must, as in the case of forging your personal style, find your vision of your future career, and then follow it as best you can. No vision, not much of a future

key lesson: “Luck favors the prepared mind.” In this way I can illustrate how the individual’s preparation before encountering the problem can often lead to recognition, formulation, and solution. Great results in science and engineering are “bunched” in the same person too often for success to be a matter of random luck


TODO: think about a sensible experiment design 


Society:

Society is steadily moving from a material goods society to an information service society. At the time of the American Revolution, say 1780 or so, over 90% of the people were essentially farmers—now farmers are a very small percent of workers. Similarly, before WW-II most workers were in factories—now less than half are there. In 1993, there were more people in Government (excluding the military), than there were in manufacturing! What will the situation be in 2020? As a guess I would say less than 25% of the people in the civilian work force will be handling things, the rest will be handling information in some form or other. In making a movie or a TV program you are making not so much a thing, though of course it does have a material form, as you are organizing information. Information is, of course, stored in a material form, say a book (the essence of a book is information), but information is not a material good to be consumed like food, a house, clothes, an automobile, or an airplane ride for transportation.

key Lesson: I need to stress this point; mechanisation requires you produce an equivalent product, not identically the same one. Furthermore, in any design it is now essential to consider field maintenance since in the long run it often dominates all other costs.

Simulations and Science research:
 The effects of computers on Science have been very large, and will probably continue as time goes on. My first experience in large scale computing was in the design of the original atomic bomb at Los Alamos. There was no possibility of a small scale experiment either you have a critical mass or you do not—and hence computing seemed at that time to be the only practical approach. We simulated, on primitive IBM accounting machines, various proposed designs, and they gradually came down to a design to test in the desert at Alamagordo, NM. From that one experience, on thinking it over carefully and what it meant, I realized computers would allow the simulation of many different kinds of experiments. I put that vision into practice at Bell Telephone Laboratories for many years. Somewhere in the mid-tolate 1950s in an address to the President and V.Ps of Bell Telephone Laboratories I said, “At present we are doing 1 out of 10 experiments on the computers and 9 in the labs, but before I leave it will be 9 out of 10 on the machines”. They did not believe me then, as they were sure real observations were the key to experiments and I was just a wild theoretician from the mathematics department, but you all realize by now we do somewhere between 90 % to 99 % of our experiments on the machines and the rest in the labs. And this trend will go on! It is so much cheaper to do simulations than real experiments, so much more flexible in testing, and we can even do things which cannot be done in any lab, that it is inevitable the trend will continue for some time. Again, the product was changed


- Computers have also greatly affected Engineering. Not only can we design and build far more complex things than we could by hand, we can explore many more alternate designs.
- The effects on society are also large. The most obvious illustration is computers have given top management the power to micromanage their organization, and top management has shown little or no ability to resist using this power

Foundations of the Digital (Discrete)

Logarithms - Jhon Nappier 

Babbage (1791–1871) is the next great name in the digital field, and he is often considered to be the father of modern computing. His first design was the difference engine, based on the simple idea that a polynomial can be evaluated at successive, equally spaced, values by using only a sequence of additions and subtractions, and since locally most functions can be represented by a suitable polynomial this could provide “machine made tables” (Babbage insisted the printing be done by the machine to prevent any human errors creeping in).

As has happened so often in the field of computing, Babbage had not finished with the difference engine before he conceived of the much more powerful analytical engine, which is not far from the current von Neumann design of a computer. He never got it to work; a group in England constructed (1992) a machine from his working drawings and successfully operated it as he had designed it to work!

key Lesson: The universe is made of atoms - are humans more than atoms - are computers more than bits?

The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers. 

Machines are good at accurate math operations. Manipulation of large quantities of bits at an astonishingly fast rate. Having said that…

I am reviewing this so you will be clear the machine processes bits of information according other bits, and as far as the machine is concerned there is no meaning to anything which happens—it is we who attach meaning to the bits

What is Mathematics? 

The dramatic growth in mathematics led in the 1980s to the emergence of a new definition of mathematics as the science of patterns. According to this description, the mathematician identifies and analyzes abstract patterns—numerical patterns, patterns of shape, patterns of motion, patterns of behavior, voting patterns in a population, patterns of repeating chance events, and so on. Those patterns can be either real or imagined, visual or mental, static or dynamic, qualitative or quantitative, utilitarian or recreational. They can arise from the world around us, from the pursuit of science, or from the inner workings of the human mind. Different kinds of patterns give rise to different branches of mathematics. 

For example:
• Arithmetic and number theory study the patterns of number and counting. 
• Geometry studies the patterns of shape. 
• Calculus allows us to handle patterns of motion. 
• Logic studies patterns of reasoning.
• Probability theory deals with patterns of chance.
• Topology studies patterns of closeness and position. 
• Fractal geometry studies the self-similarity found in the natural world.


The mathematicians’ reliance on abstract notation is a reflection of the abstract nature of the patterns they study.

These days, mathematics books tend to be awash with symbols, but mathematical notation no more is mathematics than musical notation is music

To repeat, the reason for the abstract notation is the abstract nature of the patterns that mathematics helps us identify and study. For example, mathematics is essential to our understanding the invisible patterns of the universe. In 1623, Galileo wrote, The great book of nature can be read only by those who know the language in which it was written. And this language is mathematics


Then the revolutionary Dirichlet came along and said, forget the formula and concentrate on what the function does in terms of input–output behavior. A function, according to Dirichlet, is any rule that produces new numbers from old. The rule does not have to be specified by an algebraic formula. In fact, there’s no reason to restrict your attention to numbers. A function can be any rule that takes objects of one kind and produces new objects from them. This definition legitimizes functions such as the one defined on real numbers by the rule: If x is rational, set f(x) = 0; if x is irrational, set f(x) = 1.
