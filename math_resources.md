Andrew Ng’s Recommendation: 

    Replicate the latest research - 2 years  


0. The Book 

The book, which has been called “a glimpse of mathematical heaven,” presents proofs of dozens of theorems from number theory, geometry, analysis, combinatorics and graph theory

k, I'll take a crack at this:
Up to high-school level:
1. Precalculus: Precalculus: A Prelude to Calculus - Axler
2. Calculus: The Calculus Tutoring Book - Ash.
College:
3. Preparation for Collegel-level maths:
3a. General prep for high level maths: How to Study as a Mathematics Major - Alcock
3b. Proof writing: How to Prove It - A Structured Approach - Velleman OR Book of Proof (2nd ed) - Hammack (it's free!)
4. Mathematical Analysis:
4a. Good prep for Analysis: How to Think About Analysis - Alcock
4b. Understanding Analysis (2nd ed) - Abbott OR Yet Another Introduction to Analysis - Bryant (has full solutions) OR The How and Why of One Variable Calculus - Sasane OR Mathematical Analysis - A Straightforward Approach (2nd ed) - Binmore (has full solutions)
5. Discrete Mathematics (a combination of set theory, combinatorics, a bit of discrete probability and graph theory): Discrete Mathematics - Chetwynd, Diggle
6. Linear Algebra: Linear Algebra - A Modern Introduction (4th ed) - Poole
7. Probability: Introduction to Probability - Blitzstein, Hwang + online course https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110
8. Statistics: (for Bayesian) Statistical Rethinking - A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan - McElreath + online course https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdM9_N6XUUFr...
Usually you'll be doing courses on #4, #5, and #6 simultaneously.
