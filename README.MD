## About

As rising volumes of data play an increasingly central role in society, data-intensive computing systems must evolve. Moving forward: 


- Data generation will only increase 
- Data-driven organisations will become the norm 
- Organizations will know how what data to collect from day 1
- Experiment driven optimisation of operations/design etc. will be taught in classes 
- ML will be super easy to use that average joe programmer will be trained and would be easy to use it and build data products 
- Some of the basic data analysis tasks would be automated by startups that are domain specific. i.e domain specific startups will solve some of the data challenges 
- Data will analysed in the context it was generated
- Tackling data challenges and getting value out of it will still be hard
- creative bussiness strategy will still be still be left to humans  

This repo ispired from work being done at stanford's  [Future Data Systems group](http://www.futuredata.io.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/) where their mission is to design and build post-database systems that enable next-generation data-intensive applications and [stanford Dawn](democratize AI by making it dramatically easier to build AI-powered applications.)
